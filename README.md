how to implement ECTR OSGi Services in kotlin
just simple example how to implement an ECTR OSGi Service in kotlin - in this case ApplicationFileHandler.
Additionaly to the compiled plugin jar osgi-example-kotlin-1.0.0.jar you have to put kotlin-osgi-bundle-1.2.41.jar to plugins directory, ECTR doesn't provide kotlin osgi bundle itself.
